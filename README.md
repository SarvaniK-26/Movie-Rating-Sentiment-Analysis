The goal of this project is to classify movie reviews based on their ratings by analyzing the text alone, predicting whether a review is positive or negative. Accurately classifying movie reviews could improve recommendation systems by helping platforms suggest films that match users' preferences. 

Collected and preprocessed dataset: IMDB
Build and train (specific baseline as model) on collected dataset and examine its performance: BoW, TF-IDF
Make the model perform better than the baseline model: Logistic Regression with GloVe embeddings, LSTM with GloVe embeddings, Encoder/Decoder architecture with Bidirectional LSTM
